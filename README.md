# README: a mini tutorial

DOWNLOAD VSCODE: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

The readme is really important to let external people know about your project. 

Important things about this file:

- Make it short. People don't want to read too much about what you did. Make it simple.

- Provide pictures that support your arguments, if it's necessary

- Create a structure: why did you do this project? What do you want to study? What were the steps you took? What were the conclusions?

## How to create a cool readme

There are some features you can use to improve the quality of your documents. For example, by using Markdown.
Markdown is markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.

Their basics features that you can use (and will make a difference) are:


**Titles**: put a hashtag (#) prior to the title name.

    Example:

    # This is a title

**Subtitles**: write two hashtags (##) to create a substitle.

    Example:

    ## This is a subtitle

**Sub-subtitles**: put more hasthtags to create as many subtitles as you wish

    Example:

    ### This is a third title category
    #### And this one is a fourth
    ##### Is this endless?
    ###### Help

**Bold text**: use ** at the beginning and at the end of the text

    Example:

    This text **is now in bold**

**Italic text**: use * at the beginning and at the end of the text

    Example:

    This text *is now in italics*

**Bullet points**: use - every new line

Example:

- First
- DSEcdh
- Sadsa

**Cardinal bullet pints**: write (number). at the beginning of a new line

    Example:

1. DSAdasd
2. sdadasda

**Images**: use this code below:

<img src="images/Katas.jpg" width = 300 alt="Alt text that describes the graphic" title="Title text" />
